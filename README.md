--still in early development--

simple 3D-like raycaster written in 16 bit x86 assembly.

Intended to be run in DOS emulators (only tested with dosbox and dosemu on linux).

Dependencies: nasm, dosbox/dosemu/any dos emulator

To run: 

nasm -f bin -o main.com main.asm

dosbox main.com


formatting is all screwed up because of my inconsistent use of noexpandtab in my vimrc, will fix at some point in the future probably
